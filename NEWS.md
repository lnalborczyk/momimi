# momimi 0.0.1

* Adding a `NEWS.md` file to track changes.

# momimi 0.0.2

* Adding the 3-parameter version of TMM (free parameters are the relative motor execution threshold, the peak time, and the curvature).

# momimi 0.0.3

* Adding the possibility to include within-trial (diffusive) noise.
* Fixing the 3-parameter version of the TMM (TMM3).

# momimi 0.0.4

* Fixing the plotting method of momimi_sim.
* It is now possible to estimate the amount of between-trial variability (noise) in the TMM3 (which thus now has 4 free parameters).
